- fetch() method request is sent to server for a an array of cards which are stored in deck
- background-image is updated as each card container is recieved from the fetch 
- Server limit for maximum card in a request is 52 , hence Server Limit = Cards Left in the deck
- window.location = window.location is used to refresh the page without reloading the tab.
